### About Me

Hi, my name is ZJ. I love contributing to the open-source data science community. I mainly code in R and Julia with a dash of Python and a minimal amount of Scala thrown in. 

#### Projects

| Project | Language | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| [`{disk.frame}`](https://github.com/DiskFrame/disk.frame) | R | {disk.frame} [https://diskframe.com](https://diskframe.com) is the most popular larger-than-RAM data manipulation framework in R. |
| [SortingLab.jl](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/SortingLab.jl) | Julia | Some of the _fastest_ sorting algorithms in Julia including faster `String` sorting and `sortperm` (i.e. R's `order`) algorithms |
| [JDF.jl](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/JDF.jl) | Julia | A fast DataFrames serialization format and package. |
| [ShortStrings.jl](https://github.com/JuliaString/ShortStrings.jl) | Julia | A package that uses Integer (bits types) to store strings more efficiently. Great for sorting and group-by operations. It's been handed over to the JuliaString org. Note: you probably should be using InlineStrings.jl instead |
| [TableScraper.jl](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/TableScraper.jl) | Julia | A simple scraper for well-formed tables from webapges |
| [PkgVersionHelper.jl](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/PkgVersionHelper.jl) | Julia | A one function, `upcheck()`, package for checking if your Project.toml contains the most up-to-date packages |
| [DataConvenience.jl](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/DataConvenience.jl) | Julia | Some convenience functions for data manipulation and data related tasks |
| [CuCountMap](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/CuCountMap.jl) | Julia | Fast CUDA.jl based `countmap` of small types e.g. UInt8 |
| [Parquet writer in Julia](https://github.com/JuliaIO/Parquet.jl) | Julia | I wrote the Parquet writer in pure Julia which was contributed back to Parquet.jl | 

**Other contriutions**: I have also contributed a fast `countmap` in StatsBase.jl for small type.

#### Interesting Projects I can no longer find time to maintain

| Project | Language | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| [JLBoost.jl](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/JLBoost.jl) | Julia | A pure Julia implementation of XGBoost-like boosting trees |
| [ShinySky](https://github.com/AnalytixWare/ShinySky) | R | A collection of Shiny widget. One of the earliest "popular" Shiny packages. |
| [FastGroupBy](https://github.com/xiaodaigh/FastGroupBy.jl) | Julia | A fast group by functionality. I shared the ideas I had with the main developer of DataFrames.jl and DataFrames.jl were onto the same kind of ideas anyway, so they ended up optimizing the group-by. This makes it unnecesssary to keep maintaining the package. |
